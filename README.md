Lets refactor this emacs to have:

use-package
org mode presentation


try to limit git submodules
cask? lets reduce the moving parts, limit for now.

Thoughts?  Do I need to declare emacs bankruptcy and clean slate?  No not really. I like my configs.

I guess its to super optimize  

  - make it possibly load faster

  - make it spiffier with org mode
