An .emacs.d that went the journey of

  - package.el with many require statements
  - using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) for much of the package setup
  - using org-mode for organization
  - using [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) rather than package.el with elpa/melpa/etc
  - using [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el)
